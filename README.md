This is a number guessing game. 
The computer will pick a random number between 19 and 120 and display it on the screen. 
Each crystal represents a random number between 1 and 12.
Create a matching number by clicking on the crystals.
Your number will be displayed on the screen.
Each time you click on a crystal the corresponding number will be added to your total.
If you can get to the number without going over then you win.
